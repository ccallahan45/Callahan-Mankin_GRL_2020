This repository contains processed data and analysis code required to replicate the results of Callahan & Mankin (2020), "The influence of internal climate variability on projections of synoptically driven Beijing haze." (Geophysical Research Letters).

All required data is stored in the "Data" folder, and Jupyter notebooks for each figure are in the FigureScripts folder.
